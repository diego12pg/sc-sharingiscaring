- This SuperCollider patch was created as a live coding environment in which the performer can modify the quality of the sounds in real-time. For this, I used a `ProxySpace`. This means that you do not have to kill the sound to modify it. 

- The patch consists in seven stations with different types of sounds. The order in which they have been programmed is a suggestion and the performer is free to play them in any order they would like.

- The performer is not required to use all the sounds. The piece naturally goes into a noisy character, but it is totally okay if the performer prefers to avoid these sonorities.

- If the performer is new to the world of live coding in SuperCollider, there are suggestions included in the patch of what parameters to change in order to get interesting sonorities.
